            <h1>Welcome to the Mr. Terminal website!</h1>
            <p>Currently, there's nothing at the moment. Maybe it'll look cool in future?</p>

            <h2>What will this website offer?</h2>
            <p>Let me break it down for ya.</p>

            <h3>The Blog</h3>
            <p>Whatever I have to say in my mind, I may post it here.</p>
            <p>
                Okay, maybe that's not really true, but I do want to share some things because of a lot of things.
                Like software, commentary about how I was able to get into XYZ, quick little things about a photo I took... basically, anything I can come up with.
                So yeah, just words out of my mouth.
            </p>

            <h3>Videos</h3>
            <p>
                Usually quick videos I make using the Source Filmmaker because why not?
                But I also make random videos because after all, what else can you make with software at your fingertips?
                Maybe I'll get into making videos that have to do with Discord conversations. Maybe with a good spin.
            </p>

            <h3>Renders</h3>
            <p>
                Okay, this is a good one!
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been making renders since 2018 or 2019 for the most part. The majority of the renders are made using Source Filmmaker or Blender.
                Ranging from Vocaloid to my original character, it's pretty much a land of imagination.
                And if you expect professional quality? Ehh... not really. More like "quality of an intermediate artist." Maybe.
            </p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                There's nothing special about that page. Do I really have to explain it?
            </p>

            <p>
                So yeah, there's that. I may have to explain more during development of this website. Check back and maybe you'll see something new.
