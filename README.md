_The Mr. Terminal Website HTML project is currently postponed. **mr-terminal.github.io/Mr-Terminal/** is the sucessor to this project._

# The Mr. Terminal Website
My website for anyone to look at, and grab at! This is a passion project of mine to build upon.

# What's this supposed to be?
This website is a passion project of mine to build upon because I want to share some things that I have. From pictures to videos, raw software projects, and many more! This is (quite possibly) not your average teenager, oh no. Never hear that everyday, huh?

# Where can I see it?
At this moment, I don't have a place to host my website, so for now, you can download the website documents on the Releases page (once I start building the website and release the files).

# License
This website uses The Unlicense, so that means anyone can grab the code and use it for own purpose, including you! I believe making this website open for anyone means we can make the internet a bit of a better place. After all, we are kind tired of closed source code, right?
