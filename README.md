# The Mr. Terminal Website
My website for anyone to look at, and grab at! This is a passion project of mine to build upon.

# What's this supposed to be?
This website is a passion project of mine to build upon because I want to share some things that I have. From pictures to videos, raw software projects, and many more! This is (quite possibly) not your average teenager, oh no. Never hear that everyday, huh?

# License
This website uses The Unlicense, so that means anyone can grab the code and use it for own purpose, including you! I believe making this website open for anyone means we can make the internet a bit of a better place. After all, we are kind tired of closed source code, right?
